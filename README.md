# hello-world
/The very entry to my developer life/

Actually, this isn't the first time I present myself as a developer. It's funny - here, I almost wrote "programmer" and "coder" instead of developer. Thats is because I'm Brazilian ( < ---- wow, nice soft wrap there, GitHub <3), and in Portuguese, which is the language Brazilian people speak (not to be confused with Spanish, please), the most common word for developers is 'programadores'. 

So, yeah, on my linkedin you can see I'm a 'programadora iniciante', and that means I am a junior developer.

Also, it says there that I'm a translator. Return: True. LOL

This 'read-me-about-me' says it all.
